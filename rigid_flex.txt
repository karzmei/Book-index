\section{Introduction and statement of results}

The subject of the present work is function theory on symplectic manifolds.
We focus on the interplay between rigidity and flexibility of the Poisson bracket.\\

Recall that a symplectic structure on an even-dimensional manifold $M^{2n}$ is a closed differential 2-form $\om$, whose top power $\om^n$ vanishes nowhere.
The classical Darboux theorem states that locally any symplectic manifold looks as the standard symplectic vector space $\R^{2n}$ with coordinates $(p_1, \ldots, p_n, q_1, \ldots, q_n)$ equipped with the symplectic form $\sum_{i=1}^n dp_i \wedge dq_i$.
%
Another important example of a symplectic manifold is a surface equipped with an area form.

A fundamental notion of symplectic geometry is the Poisson bracket, $\pois{F,G}$, of a pair of smooth functions $F$ and $G$ on $M$. Locally, in Darboux coordinates $p_i, q_i$ ($i = 1\ldots n$),
\begin{align}
	\pois{F,G} = \sum_{i=1}^n
	\left( 
	\frac{\de F}{\de q_i}\frac{\de G}{\de p_i} - \frac{\de G}{\de q_i}\frac{\de F}{\de p_i}
	\right) \;.
\end{align}

The following identity can provide a coordinate-free definition:
\begin{align} \label{poisson_brck_def_1}
\pois{F,G} \om^n = -n \cdot dF \wedge dG \wedge \om^{n-1} \;.
\end{align}


%We adopt the notation $C^\infty _c (M)$ for the space of smooth compactly supported functions on $M$. 
%Also, we write $\| F \|_q$ for the $L_q$-norm 
%$$ \| F \|_q = \left( \int_M |F|^q \om^n \right)^{1/q}$$
%associated to the volume form $\om^n$ on $M$. 
%
%Here $q \in [1,\infty]$, where by $L_\infty$-norm we mean the uniform norm 
%$\| F \|_\infty = \max_M |F|$.

\subsection{Measurements with the Poisson bracket}

Let $(M^{2n}, \om)$ be a symplectic manifold. A significant character of our story is the functional
\begin{align*}
	\Phi_p : C^\infty_c(M) \times C^\infty_c(M) \to \R_{\geq 0},\ 
	(F,G) \mapsto \| \pois{F,G} \|_p \;.
\end{align*}

%\trmk{Maybe write notations here?}\\
Here $C_c^\infty (M)$ stands for the space of smooth compactly supported functions on $M$, and we write $\| F\|_p$ for the $L_p$-norm 
$$ 
\| F \|_p = \left( \int_M |F|^p \om^n \right)^{1/p}
$$
associated to the volume form $\om^n$ on $M$.
We consider $p \in [1,\infty]$, where by $L_\infty$-norm we mean the uniform norm 
$\| F \|_\infty = \max_M |F|$.\\

It was shown 
that for $p=\infty$ this functional, $\Phi_\infty$, is lower semi-continuous with respect to the $L_\infty$-norm on $C^\infty_c (M)$. (See \cite{polterov_rosen2014func_theory}, \cite{entov_polterov_c0_rig_poiss_br} and \cite{buhovsky_2/3_conv_pb_2010}. These texts deal with the multidimensional case, extending previous results by Cardin-Viterbo (\cite{cardin_viterbo_08}) and Zapolsky (\cite{zapolsky_quasi_and_pb_surfaces_07}).)
This fact is quite surprising, since the Poisson bracket depends on the first derivatives of the functions, while the convergence is in the uniform norm only. 
Let us mention also, that the functional $\Phi_p$ is not continuous, as we can slightly alter the two functions, while changing their derivatives extensively. \\

Our first result deals with the behaviour of the functional $\Phi_p$ in the $L_q$-topology for general  $p$ and $q$.

\begin{thm} \label{thm: thm_pb_non_rigidity_L_p_L_q_combined_intro}
	Let $1 \leq q <\infty$ and $1\leq p \leq \infty$. For any two functions $F,G \in C^\infty_c(M)$ that are not Poisson commuting ($\pois{F,G} \neq 0$),
	there exist two sequences $F_N,\,G_N \in C^\infty_c (M)$ with $F_N \xrightarrow[{L_q}]{} F$, $G_N \xrightarrow[{L_q}]{} G$ and $\poisnm{F_N,G_N} _p \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$. 
	
\end{thm}

%The same holds for $p=\infty$, $1 \leq q < \infty$, by a similar proof, as we would see. 
%\trmk{Combine? YES.}\\

In fact, we will construct two sequences satisfying
	$F_N \xrightarrow[{L_\infty}]{} F$, $G_N \xrightarrow[{L_q}]{} G$ 
	with ${\pois{F_N,G_N} \equiv 0}$.

Thus, in these cases the semicontinuity phenomenon disappears and the rigidity we witnessed in the case of the uniform norm is replaced by flexibility.

The case $q = \infty$, $p < \infty$ remains open.\\


\subsection{Poisson bracket invariant of quadruples, $pb_4^q$}

Next, we discuss another measurement that has to do with the Poisson bracket.
%
Let $X_0, X_1, Y_0, Y_1$ be compact subsets of a symplectic manifold $(M,\om)$, such that 
$X_0 \cap X_1 = Y_0 \cap Y_1 = \emptyset$.
Fix some $1\leq q \leq \infty$ and set

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_pb_4_def_1}
pb_4 ^q (X_0,X_1,Y_0,Y_1) = \inf_{(F,G)} \| \pois{F,G} \|_q \;,
\end{equation}
%
where the infimum is taken over all pairs $F,G\in C^\infty_c(M)$,
such that 
$$
F \restr_{X_0} \leq 0,\ F \restr_{X_1} \geq 1 \;,\ 
G \restr_{Y_0} \leq 0,\ G \restr_{Y_1} \geq 1 \;.
$$
%
In the notation $pb_4^q$, $pb$ stands for Poisson bracket, the subindex 4 is for the fact that we deal with a quadruple of subsets, and $q$ is to signify the $L_q$-norm.

	%\caption{}
\end{figure}

It is known (see \cite{buhovsky_entov_polterovich_2012poisson_brck}, \cite{polterov_rosen2014func_theory}) that for certain quadruples of subsets, $pb_4^\infty$ is strictly positive, thus manifesting the rigidity of the uniform norm of the Poisson bracket.
In this work, we explore the properties of the functional $pb_4^q$ also when $1 \leq q < \infty$.

We show that if $\dim M = 2$, i.e. in the case of $M$ being a surface, rigidity of $pb_4^q$ persists, whereas in the multidimensional case $pb_4^q$ exhibits flexible behavior. 


\subsubsection{Rigidity in the 2-dimensional case}

We shall consider the invariant $pb_4^q$ of the four sides of a quadrilateral 
on a smooth surface $M$ equipped with an area form $\om$.
%in a connected plane domain $M \subset \R^2$. We examine both the situation when $M$ has finite and when its area is infinite.\\
%
For us, a curvilinear quadrilateral on a smooth surface $M$ is the image of an embedding of a square $[0,1]^2 \subset \R^2$ into the interior of $M$. 
% \footnote{(Take a different def?)}

Suppose that $X_0,Y_0, X_1,Y_1$ are sides of a curvilinear quadrilateral $\Pi \subset M$ taken in counterclockwise order.
We consider $pb_4^q (\Pi) := pb_4^q (X_0,X_1,Y_0,Y_1)$.

It turns out that in the case $q>1$ the value of $pb_4^q(\Pi)$ depends on the areas of $\Pi$ and $M$, while $pb_4^{q=1} (\Pi)$ is independent of these areas.
%


%\begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_q=1_dim=2}
%	%For a simply connected surface $M$ and $\Pi$ as above, $pb_4 ^{q=1}(\Pi) = 2$.
%	For $M = \R ^2$ and $\Pi \subset M$ a curvilinear quadrilateral, $pb_4 ^{q=1}(\Pi) = 2$.
%\end{thm}
%
%This result can be viewed as a limit case of the following (in case $M$ has finite area).
%
%\begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_thm_q>1_bounded_region_plane_pb_4_quadr}
%	Denote $A = \Area(\Pi)$ and $B = \Area(M)$. Then 
%	$\displaystyle{pb_4^q (\Pi) = \Big( \frac{1}{A^{q-1}} + \frac{1}{(B-A)^{q-1}} \Big)^{1/q}}$.
%\end{thm}
%
%Lastly, from the previous claim, we draw a conclusion about the behavior of $pb_4^q$ when $M=\R ^2$.
%
%\begin{cor} \label{cor: intro_thm_pb_4_q>1_dim=2,plane}
%	For a curvilinear quadrilateral $\Pi \subset \R ^2$ of area $A$, 
%	$\displaystyle{pb_4^q(\Pi) =  \frac{1}{A^{1-1/q}}}$.
%\end{cor}

%\begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_dim=2_all}
%	Let $M \subset \R^2$ be a connected domain and let $\Pi \subset M$ be a curvilinear quadrilateral. Denote $A = \Area(\Pi)$, $B = \Area(M)$.\\ 
%	(i) If $\Area(M) < \infty$, then 
%	 $\displaystyle{pb_4^q (\Pi) = \Big( \frac{1}{A^{q-1}} + \frac{1}{(B-A)^{q-1}} \Big)^{1/q}}\ $.
%	 In particular, $pb_4^1 (\Pi) = 2$.\\
%	 %
%	(ii) If $\Area(M) = \infty$, then 
%		$\displaystyle{pb_4^q(\Pi) =  \frac{1}{A^{1-1/q}}}\ $. 
%\end{thm}

\begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_dim=2_all}
	Let $(M, \om)$ be a connected symplectic surface without boundary and let $\Pi \subset M$ be a curvilinear quadrilateral. Let $1 \leq q < \infty$. Denote $A = \Area_\om(\Pi)$, $B = \Area_\om(M)$.\\ 
	(i) If $\Area(M) < \infty$, then 
	$\displaystyle{pb_4^q (\Pi) = \Big( \frac{1}{A^{q-1}} + \frac{1}{(B-A)^{q-1}} \Big)^{1/q}}\ $.
	In particular, $pb_4^1 (\Pi) = 2$.\\
	%
	(ii) If $\Area(M) = \infty$, then 
	$\displaystyle{pb_4^q(\Pi) =  \Big( \frac{1}{A^{q-1}} \Big)^{1/q}}\ $. 
\end{thm}

\begin{rmk}
	Note that (ii) is a limiting case of (i) as $B \to \infty$.
\end{rmk}


\subsubsection{$pb_4^q$ of a curve on a surface}

The quantity $pb_4^q$ gives rise to an invariant of simple closed curves on surfaces. Consider such a curve $\tau$ on a smooth connected oriented surface $\Sigma$ without boundary. \\
% 
%
Divide the curve into four segments $\Delta_1, \Delta_2, \Delta_3, \Delta_4$ and consider $pb_4^q (\Delta_1, \Delta_2, \Delta_3, \Delta_4)$ of this quadruple. 
%
We will see that this quantity does not depend on the division of $\tau$, and thus this construction
defines an invariant $pb_4(\tau)$ of the curve $\tau$. To the best of our knowledge, this definition is new even for $q=+\infty$.\\
%
It appears that $pb_4^q (\tau)$ captures some topological information regarding the curve $\tau$. 
Namely, it distinguishes separating simple closed curves from non-separating ones. 
Recall that $\tau$ is called non-separating if $\Sigma \setm \tau$ is connected.
If a curve is non-separating, $pb_4^q(\tau)$ vanishes, while it is not the case for a separating curve.

\begin{thm}	\label{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_non_sep_curve_on_surface}
	Let $(\Sigma,\om)$ be a smooth connected symplectic surface without boundary, 
	and let $\tau \subset \Sigma$ be a smooth simple closed curve.
	If $\tau$ is non-separating, then $pb_4^q (\tau) = 0$ for any $1 \leq q \leq \infty$.
\end{thm}


%\begin{thm}
%	Suppose $(S,\om)$ is a smooth oriented connected symplectic surface without boundary. Suppose in addition that $S$ has finite area, and that $\tau \subset S$ is a smooth closed separating curve.
%	Then for $1 \leq q < \infty$ we have $pb_4^q(\tau) \neq 0$.
%\end{thm}

\begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_pb_4_sep_curve_surface_no_bdry_finite_areaed_components}
	Let $(\Sigma,\om)$ be a smooth connected symplectic surface without boundary, 
	and let $\tau \subset \Sigma$ be a smooth simple closed separating curve. 
	Suppose that the components $\Sig_1$ and $\Sig_2$ of $\Sigma \setm \tau$ have finite areas $A$ and $B$ respectively.
	Then $pb_4^q$ does not vanish, and moreover,
	\begin{equation}
	pb_4^q(\tau) = 	
		\begin{cases}
			2							 & \text{if } \ q=1  \;, \\
			\left(\frac{1}{A^{q-1}} + \frac{1}{B^{q-1}} \right) ^{1/q}       & \text{if } \ 1< q < \infty \;, \\
			\max (\frac{1}{A}, \frac{1}{B})				     & \text{if } \ q=\infty \;.
		\end{cases}	
	%
	\end{equation}
\end{thm}





\subsubsection{$pb_4^q$: the multidimensional case}

%\trmk{Here we present a new mechanism for vanishing of $pb_4^q$ in higher dimensions.}\\

Here we present a new mechanism revealing that $pb_4^q$ vanishes in higher dimensions in certain situations.

 
% As opposed to the rigidity results in the two-dimensional case, we will see that a different phenomenon takes place in higher dimensions. We show that $pb_4^q$ vanishes for certain $q$-s, and a specific kind of quadruples. 
 
 \begin{thm} \label{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_vanish_high_dim}
 	Let $X_0, X_1, Y_0, Y_1$ be compact subsets of a symplectic manifold $(M^{2n},\om)$, where $X_1$ is a submanifold, such that 
 	$X_0 \cap X_1 = Y_0 \cap Y_1 = \emptyset$. 
 	%
 	Denote $d = \dim X_1$ and suppose $d \leq 2n-2$. Then 
 	$pb_4^q(X_0, X_1, Y_0, Y_1) = 0$ whenever $q \leq 2n - d, n\geq 2$.
 \end{thm}
% 

Interestingly enough, $pb_4^\infty$ for such a quadruple can be positive. For instance, examine
	$$
	{[0,1]^2 \times T^* S^1 \subset  \R^2 \times T^* S^1}
	$$
and denote the sides of $[0,1]^2$
by $a, b, c, d$, listed in cyclic order. Pick a fixed circle (the zero section) $S^1$ on the cylinder $T^* S^1$.
Consider the quadruple 
	$$
	(X_0, Y_0, X_1, Y_1) = (a \times S^1, b \times S^1, c \times S^1, d \times S^1) \;,
	$$
which is called \emph{the stabilization} of $(a,b,c,d)$ 
(see \cite{buhovsky_entov_polterovich_2012poisson_brck}). 
%
Here for $X_1 = c \times S^1$, we have $d = \dim X_1 = 2$ and $n=2$. 
For $q = \infty$ we have 
	$pb_4^\infty (a \times S^1, b \times S^1, c \times S^1, d \times S^1) > 0$,
see \cite[section 7.5.4]{polterov_rosen2014func_theory},
i.e. positivity of $pb_4^\infty$ on the sides of the quadrilateral survives the stabilization. 
%
\Cref{thm: intro_thm_pb_4_vanish_high_dim} above shows that this is not longer valid for $q \leq 2n-d=2$. 
The case of finite $q > 2$ is currently out of reach.
