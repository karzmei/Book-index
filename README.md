# Book-index
Given a (long) text, a book text, we want to produce a back-of-the-book index for it.
In fact I want to deal specifically with scientific texts (initially written in .tex (latex)), but except for a proper preprocessing, currently it doesn't make a difference.

Description: TO BE ADDED. :)
